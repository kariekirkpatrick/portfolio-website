                <h1>A little about me...</h1>
                <p>Well, one day I'm gonna have to come up with a little story and some interesting things to say about me and my background. I'll tell you why I love visual &amp; web design and how I came to find it. I'll try to explain to you why it's not so different from making cakes, and maybe I'll even get your mouth to water a little bit.</p><br>
                <p>I will also eventually get a better picture of me. Maybe a few. And I'll make this page way more exciting.</p>
